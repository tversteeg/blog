My name is Thomas Versteeg, I'm a Rust developer and a Linux fan, located in Hilversum, the Netherlands.
My text editor of choice is ~~NeoVim~~ Helix. The distro I've been using for at least 10 years is Debian.

My interests around computer science are wide and include graphics, compiler/programming language design, artificial intelligence and systems programming.

I am an open source enthusiast, I have a big library of projects and tools I've made over the years.

In my spare time I like to swim, play badminton, travel & cook vegan food.
