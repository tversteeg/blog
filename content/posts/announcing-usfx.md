[Î¼sfx](https://github.com/tversteeg/usfx) is a library I started developing.

It's part of a set of tools that can be used to create game engines.

The library allows you to create audio samples in real time using different synthesis effects & oscillators.
Oscillator buffers are cached, so layering a lot of oscillators and playing them at the same time is no problem.
