[Const-tweaker](https://github.com/tversteeg/const-tweaker) is a library I started developing.

It's part of a set of tools that can be used to create game engines.

It allows you to create `const` variables that can be adjusted during runtime in a web GUI.

This is useful when you're creating games and want to tweak a variable real quick, for example the movement speed of a character in a platformer or the gravity in a space-simulator.
