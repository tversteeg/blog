[Const-tweaker](https://github.com/tversteeg/const-tweaker) is a Rust library to change the value of `const` variables during runtime with a web GUI.

<!-- more -->

It's part of a set of tools that can be used to create game engines.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tversteeg/const-tweaker/master/img/example.gif)

This is useful when you're creating games and want to tweak a variable real quick, for example the movement speed of a character in a platformer or the gravity in a space-simulator.
